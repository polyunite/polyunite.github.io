                  <p>In Chaos Reigns a player must manage a limited amount of resources which will be used to purchase buildings and units. 
                  The player must then micromanage their units to move around a map and fight their opponents who are ultimately trying to achieve the same thing. 
                  The player who best manages their resources, efficiently builds their units and manipulates their special abilities, 
                  reacts strategically to what their opponent is building and makes the best tactical decisions, will win the game. </p>
                  <img src="images/WinLose.png" width="380" height="38" border="0" id="WinLose" />
                  <p>A player wins the game by using their units to destroy an opponent's base. 
                  Every player must protect their own base from destruction while seeking out their opponent. 
                  Every building in the opponents base must be destroyed in order to win the game. 
                  A player must set their units to attack each building in their opponents base. 
                  These buildings have health which will regain over time and can be rebuilt if destroyed. 
                  If all buildings reach zero health however without being rebuilt that player looses the game.</p>

                  <p>Each player recieve one base which contains 5 ruins. 
                  These ruins can be built into any combinations of 5 buildings.
                   Each building costs a varying amount of resources and can only be built if the player has enough of the required resources.                   
					Buildings have one main function; to produce units. 
                    Once a building is constructed it will be operational to start training units. Each building has 3 unique units to choose from.
